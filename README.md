This project shows a small code to create a basic two-qubit quantum circuit with entanglement, and uses measurements and Qiskit visualization tools to show the interlinked states of the entangled qubits. A must for anyone interested  in beginning quantum computing, as follows Qiskit's latest syntax (as of 2024) - many beginners, following syntax from Qiskit's older tutorials, have difficulty as the syntax has usually been updated - for example, on how to fetch Aer. This problem is exacerabated by the fact that all of Qiskit's tutorials (expecially intoductory level ones) are from 2020. The code contains helpful comments to help a beginner understand the logic behind the syntax. If you have any additional questions about the code, feel free to email me.
